Hello, this is my test project written in react native(expo).  
This application allows the user to view free games, sort and filter them.  
I added the ability to follow the link to read the full description of the game in the browser.  
You can click any game to see it.

> Tech stack: *axios, styled-components, react-query, constate, expo/vector-icons*
